# SQL1 - Data Engineering Course Project

This repository contains the datasets and SQL files used for Homework 1 and the term project for the Data Engineering course. The goal of the project is to work with relational data, focusing on importing, analyzing, and performing operations on datasets using SQL.



## Datasets

The following datasets have been included in the project and are located in the `HW1` folder:
- **trans-atlantic-slave-dataset.csv**: A dataset that contains information related to the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, including voyage details, locations, and captives' data.
- **intra-america-slave-trade.csv**: A dataset that contains information about slave trade routes within the Americas.
- **AfricanNamesDatabase.csv**: This dataset includes names and details of enslaved individuals, providing additional context for the trans-Atlantic slave voyages.
- **worldcities.csv**: A dataset containing city names and their corresponding latitude and longitude for potential mapping and geographic analysis.
